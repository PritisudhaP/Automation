Welcome to the Enspire-OMS Interface
===============

This interface controls stores, products, inventory, pricing, purchasing, receiving and employee management. It allows one central point of access to manage many stores, depending on permissions.

### 1. This repo bowers in other PRIVATE repos!!
####You must setup your system to allow and you must have access to them!

The tutorial below will walk you through how to setup your .netrc and .gitconfig files so they force Bower to use https, instead of SSH keys.
